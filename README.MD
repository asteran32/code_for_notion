# Welcome to my personal learning repository!

## About

This repository contains a collection of code about ML/DL and Computer Vision project related to my learning journey and personal interests. It is intended to serve as a reference for myself, as well as a way to share my progress and insights with others.

## Table of contents


**ML/DL**

- [Face recognition using the Facenet with pretrained models](./face_recognition_MTCNN)
- [Implementing a simple perceptron network using Numpy](./ml_perceptron)
- [Implementing SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimization algorithm using Numpy](./sgd)

**Vision**

- [Color space segmentation to separate different objects on their color based](./color_space_segmentation)
- [Image operation using Numpy including resizing removing and thresholding](./image_operation)
- [Streaming video from CSI camera via GStreamer pipeline](./py_stream_dual_cam)


**Etc**
